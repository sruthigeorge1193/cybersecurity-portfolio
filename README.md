# Cybersecurity Portfolio — Sruthi George

## About Me
I am a software developer with 5 years of experience in .NET transitioning into cybersecurity. I hold a Master’s degree in Computing (Cybersecurity) from Curtin University and am currently preparing for the CompTIA Security+ certification.

My background in software engineering gives me strong insight into application behavior, debugging, and system architecture — skills I am applying toward security analysis, threat detection, and defensive security practices. This portfolio documents my hands-on labs, investigations, and learning progress as I build practical cybersecurity expertise.
